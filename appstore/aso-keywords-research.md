# ASO Keyword Research — HourFlow

## Methodology

Keywords were selected by balancing **search volume** (how often people search the term), **relevance** (how well it describes HourFlow), and **competition** (how many established apps target this keyword). We prioritize niche trade/contractor terms where big players (Toggl, Harvest, FreshBooks) have less presence.

**Important:** Apple's algorithm indexes the App Name, Subtitle, and Keyword field together. Words already present in the name ("HourFlow", "Time", "Invoice") or subtitle ("Track", "Hours", "Send", "Invoices") do NOT need to be repeated in the keyword field — Apple indexes them automatically.

## Candidate Keywords (30 keywords evaluated)

| # | Keyword | Search Volume | Competition | Relevance | Notes |
|---|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| 1 | `freelancer` | High | High | ★★★★★ | Core audience. High volume justifies the competition. |
| 2 | `contractor` | Medium | Medium | ★★★★★ | Key audience. Less competitive than "freelancer." |
| 3 | `billing` | High | High | ★★★★★ | Core function. Pairs well with invoice terms. |
| 4 | `timer` | High | Medium | ★★★★★ | Core function. "Job timer" is a strong compound. |
| 5 | `job` | High | High | ★★★★☆ | Generic but compounds well: "job timer," "job tracker." |
| 6 | `billable` | Low-Med | Low | ★★★★★ | Very relevant. Low competition = easy ranking. |
| 7 | `plumber` | Low | Very Low | ★★★★★ | Niche trade term. Almost zero app competition. |
| 8 | `electrician` | Low | Very Low | ★★★★★ | Same rationale as plumber. Underserved niche. |
| 9 | `handyman` | Low | Very Low | ★★★★★ | Underserved. Direct target audience. |
| 10 | `tradesman` | Very Low | Very Low | ★★★★★ | Niche but perfectly describes our audience. |
| 11 | `work` | Very High | Very High | ★★★☆☆ | Broad. Helps compound terms: "work hours," "work log." |
| 12 | `log` | Medium | Low | ★★★★☆ | "Work log," "hour log." Low competition. |
| 13 | `timesheet` | Medium | Medium | ★★★★☆ | Classic search term. Users look for digital timesheets. |
| 14 | `receipt` | Medium | Medium | ★★★☆☆ | Related to invoicing, but slightly off-core. |
| 15 | `estimate` | Medium | Medium | ★★★★☆ | Tradespeople search for estimate/quote tools. |
| 16 | `quote` | Medium | Medium | ★★★★☆ | Pairs with "estimate." Relevant for contractors. |
| 17 | `gig` | Medium | Low | ★★★★☆ | Gig economy term. Growing search volume. |
| 18 | `payroll` | Medium | High | ★★☆☆☆ | Not exactly our function. Skip. |
| 19 | `self-employed` | Low | Low | ★★★★★ | Perfect audience descriptor. Low competition. |
| 20 | `offline` | Low | Very Low | ★★★★★ | Key differentiator. People search "offline invoice." |
| 21 | `clock` | Medium | Medium | ★★★☆☆ | "Clock in/out." Slightly employee-oriented. |
| 22 | `expense` | Medium | High | ★★☆☆☆ | Not a core feature. Pass. |
| 23 | `wages` | Low | Low | ★★★☆☆ | Related but more employee-focused. Maybe. |
| 24 | `earnings` | Low | Low | ★★★★☆ | Dashboard shows earnings. Good compound. |
| 25 | `freelance` | Medium | High | ★★★★★ | Adjective form. Apple may stem with "freelancer." |
| 26 | `payment` | High | High | ★★★★☆ | Core feature but very competitive. |
| 27 | `simple` | Medium | Low | ★★★★☆ | Key differentiator. "Simple invoice," "simple timer." |
| 28 | `solo` | Low | Very Low | ★★★★★ | "Solo contractor," "solo business." Perfect fit. |
| 29 | `field` | Low | Low | ★★★★☆ | "Field service," "field worker." Relevant for trades. |
| 30 | `mobile` | High | Very High | ★★☆☆☆ | Too generic. Skip. |

## Final Keyword String

**100-character limit.** Words in App Name ("HourFlow", "Time", "Invoice") and Subtitle ("Track", "Hours", "Send", "Invoices") are already indexed by Apple — do NOT repeat them.

### Final String (99 characters):

```
freelancer,contractor,billing,timer,job,billable,plumber,electrician,handyman,timesheet,estimate,gig
```

**Character count:** 100 / 100 ✅

### Justification

| Keyword | Why Included |
|---------|-------------|
| `freelancer` | Primary audience. High volume worth the competition. |
| `contractor` | Primary audience. Medium competition, high relevance. |
| `billing` | Core function word. Complements "invoice" from the title. |
| `timer` | Core feature. Compounds with "job" → "job timer." |
| `job` | High volume. Compounds: "job timer," "job tracker," "job hours." |
| `billable` | Low competition gem. "Billable hours" is exactly our use case. |
| `plumber` | Near-zero competition. Direct target user. Niche gold. |
| `electrician` | Same — an underserved niche we own. |
| `handyman` | Completes the trades trifecta. |
| `timesheet` | Classic search term for our exact function. |
| `estimate` | Tradespeople search for quoting/estimate tools. |
| `gig` | Growing gig-economy term. Low competition. |

### Why These Were Cut

| Keyword | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `tradesman` | Very low search volume; "contractor" covers this. |
| `work` | Too generic to justify a keyword slot. |
| `log` | Lower priority than trade-specific terms. |
| `offline` | Very low search volume despite being a differentiator. Better in description. |
| `quote` | Overlaps with "estimate." One is enough. |
| `simple` | Better used in description and promo text. |
| `solo` | Very low volume. Better in description. |
| `self-employed` | Hyphenated terms waste characters. Better in description. |
| `field` | Too ambiguous on its own. |
| `freelance` | Apple likely stems this with "freelancer." Redundant. |

## Competitor Keywords to AVOID (Trademarked)

Do **not** include these in keywords — they are trademarked app names and Apple may reject or penalize:

- ❌ `Toggl` — Toggl Track (time tracking competitor)
- ❌ `Harvest` — Harvest (time & invoicing competitor)
- ❌ `FreshBooks` — FreshBooks (invoicing competitor)
- ❌ `QuickBooks` — Intuit QuickBooks
- ❌ `Clockify` — Clockify (free time tracker)
- ❌ `Wave` — Wave Financial (invoicing)
- ❌ `Xero` — Xero (accounting)
- ❌ `Square` — Square Invoices
- ❌ `PayPal` — PayPal (payment processor; mention in description only)
- ❌ `Venmo` — Venmo (same)
- ❌ `Jobber` — Jobber (field service management)
- ❌ `Housecall Pro` — Housecall Pro (home service software)

Apple's guidelines (§2.3.7) prohibit using competitor names in metadata.

## Long-Tail Opportunities

Apple's algorithm creates **compound keywords** by combining words from your name + subtitle + keyword field. Here are the valuable long-tail phrases HourFlow will rank for:

| Long-Tail Phrase | Formed From |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "freelancer time tracker" | keyword + name + name |
| "contractor invoice" | keyword + name |
| "job timer" | keyword + keyword |
| "billable hours tracker" | keyword + subtitle + name |
| "plumber invoice app" | keyword + name |
| "electrician time tracking" | keyword + name |
| "handyman billing" | keyword + keyword |
| "freelancer timesheet" | keyword + keyword |
| "gig timer" | keyword + keyword |
| "estimate invoice" | keyword + name |
| "job hours tracker" | keyword + subtitle + name |
| "contractor billing" | keyword + keyword |
| "plumber time tracker" | keyword + name |
| "billable time tracker" | keyword + name |

These compound terms are where HourFlow can **dominate** — big competitors don't target trade-specific combinations like "plumber invoice" or "electrician time tracking."

## Localization Notes

For future ASO expansion, consider localizing keywords for:
- 🇬🇧 UK English: `tradesman`, `VAT invoice`, `sole trader`, `self employed`
- 🇦🇺 Australian English: `tradie`, `ABN invoice`, `sole trader`
- 🇨🇦 Canadian English: `contractor`, `GST invoice`

These can be set per-locale in App Store Connect without affecting the US keyword field.
