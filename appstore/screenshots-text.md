# App Store Screenshot Text & Layout — HourFlow

> Text and captions for 5–6 App Store screenshots.  
> Design these at **1290 × 2796 px** (iPhone 15 Pro Max) — this covers the 6.7" requirement and scales down for all other sizes.

---

## Screenshot 1 — Hero / Timer

**Headline:**
```
Track Every Billable Hour
```

**Subtitle:**
```
One tap to start. One tap to stop.
```

**App Screen to Show:**
Timer screen with the large running timer front and center. Show a client name at the top (e.g., "Johnson Kitchen Remodel") and the active timer counting up. The start/stop button should be prominent.

**Design Notes:**
- Background color: brand primary or deep gradient
- This is the first thing people see — make the timer BIG
- Show the timer mid-count (e.g., 02:34:17) for realism

---

## Screenshot 2 — Invoicing

**Headline:**
```
Professional Invoices in Seconds
```

**Subtitle:**
```
From tracked hours to sent invoice — just like that.
```

**App Screen to Show:**
Invoice preview screen showing a clean, professional invoice with a client name, line items with hours × rate, a total at the bottom, and a "Share" or "Send" button. Show a realistic invoice (e.g., "Bathroom Plumbing Repair — 3.5 hrs × $85/hr").

**Design Notes:**
- Slightly angled device mockup to add depth
- The invoice should look clean enough that a client would take it seriously
- Show the share sheet peeking up or a "Sent ✓" confirmation

## Screenshot 3 — Dashboard / Earnings

**Headline:**
```
See Your Earnings at a Glance
```

**Subtitle:**
```
Daily. Weekly. Monthly. Always know your numbers.
```

**App Screen to Show:**
Dashboard/reports screen with a bar chart or line graph showing weekly earnings. Display a prominent total (e.g., "$3,240 this week") and a breakdown by client or day. Cards or summary tiles work great here.

**Design Notes:**
- Use warm, money-green or gold accent for the earnings number
- The graph should trend upward (aspirational)
- Show enough data to look useful but not cluttered

---

## Screenshot 4 — Tags & Organization

**Headline:**
```
Tag & Organize Your Work
```

**Subtitle:**
```
Plumbing Monday. Electrical Tuesday. All sorted.
```

**App Screen to Show:**
Time entries list view with colorful tags visible (e.g., "🔧 Plumbing", "⚡ Electrical", "🏠 Renovation"). Show 4–5 recent entries with different clients and tags. A filter/sort UI element is a nice touch.

**Design Notes:**
- Colorful tags should pop against the background
- Show variety in the entries — different clients, different tags, different durations
- This screenshot demonstrates flexibility and organization

---

## Screenshot 5 — Dark Mode

**Headline:**
```
Dark Mode. Your Eyes Will Thank You.
```

**Subtitle:**
```
Early mornings. Late nights. We've got you covered.
```

**App Screen to Show:**
The timer screen (same as Screenshot 1) but in full dark mode. Show it running with a client name and active timer. The dark background with glowing accent colors should look premium.

**Design Notes:**
- Use a darker, moodier background gradient for the screenshot frame
- The device bezel should also be dark/black
- This screenshot signals polish and attention to detail
- Consider showing it slightly later in the sequence to break up visual monotony

---

## Screenshot 6 — Payment Methods

**Headline:**
```
Get Paid Faster
```

**Subtitle:**
```
PayPal · Venmo · Zelle · Cash App — their choice.
```

**App Screen to Show:**
Invoice settings or invoice detail screen showing payment method icons/links. Ideally show the invoice with a "Payment Methods" section displaying recognizable payment app icons. Could also show the settings screen where you configure your payment links.

**Design Notes:**
- Payment method logos should be recognizable but check trademark usage guidelines
- Consider using a "link" or "tap to pay" visual metaphor
- This screenshot sells the "get paid" end of the workflow — the payoff

---

## General Design Guidelines

- **Consistency:** Same background style/gradient across all 6 screenshots
- **Device Frame:** Use iPhone 15 Pro frame (or frameless with rounded corners)
- **Typography:** One headline font (bold, 48–64pt equivalent), one subtitle font (regular, 24–32pt)
- **Text Position:** Headlines above the device, subtitles below (or both above)
- **Colors:** Stick to 2–3 brand colors max plus white text
- **Accessibility:** Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA at minimum
- **Localization-ready:** Keep text separate from design files for easy translation later

## Screenshot Order Rationale

1. **Timer** — Shows the core feature immediately. "This is what the app does."
2. **Invoice** — The money shot. "You can get paid with this."
3. **Dashboard** — Social proof of value. "Look at those earnings."
4. **Tags** — Depth feature. "It's organized, not just a stopwatch."
5. **Dark Mode** — Visual variety + polish signal.
6. **Payments** — Closing argument. "You'll actually get paid."

> Most users only see screenshots 1–3 before deciding. Front-load the value.
