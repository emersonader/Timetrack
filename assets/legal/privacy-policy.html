  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> HourFlow stores all your data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal or business information on any server.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    HourFlow ("we," "our," or "the app") is a time tracking and invoicing application developed by Emerson Ader. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are committed to protecting your privacy. HourFlow is designed as an offline-first application, meaning your data stays on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    HourFlow allows you to enter and store the following types of information, all of which is kept <strong>locally on your device</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Business information (name, phone, email, address)</li>
    <li>Client information (names, phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses)</li>
    <li>Time tracking sessions (start/end times, durations, dates, notes)</li>
    <li>Invoices and billing records</li>
    <li>Hourly rates and material costs</li>
    <li>Business logo and app color preferences</li>
    <li>Payment method details (PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, Stripe usernames/links)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not collect, transmit, or have access to any of this data.</strong> All information is stored in a local SQLite database on your device and never leaves your phone.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    Since all data remains on your device, we do not "use" your information in any way. The data you enter is used solely by the app on your device to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Track time for your clients</li>
    <li>Generate and send invoices</li>
    <li>Display reports and summaries</li>
    <li>Customize the app's appearance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is stored locally on your device using a SQLite database. We do not operate servers or cloud infrastructure to store your data. This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data is as secure as your device itself</li>
    <li>If you delete the app, your data is permanently removed</li>
    <li>We cannot recover your data if it is lost</li>
    <li>We recommend using your device's built-in backup features (e.g., iCloud device backups) to protect against data loss</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    HourFlow uses the following third-party services:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect anonymized purchase and subscription data as described in their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>. This data is used solely for subscription management and does not include your business or client information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Apple App Store / StoreKit:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. Apple's handling of your payment information is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use any analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting services.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties. Since your data is stored only on your device, we have no access to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you choose to send an invoice via email or SMS, the invoice content is shared directly from your device through your device's mail or messaging app. We do not intercept or store these communications.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    HourFlow is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through the app, please contact us so we can assist you.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it. You can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>View, edit, or delete any data within the app at any time</li>
    <li>Delete all data by uninstalling the app</li>
    <li>Export your data using the app's export features (where available)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new effective date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
